# abi-decoder

The AbiDecoder is copied from https://github.com/ConsenSys/abi-decoder/blob/a03314465f0a3526b43df82f0272e35a35e0a443/index.js. We are not using the dependency directly since it pulls in web3 beta37 (we are using 1.2.1), which causes errors when installing in new node versions.

Can delete this once https://github.com/ConsenSys/abi-decoder/pull/37 is merged and released.
